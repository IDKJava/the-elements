		<h1>How to Play The Elements</h1><br/>
		<h2>The Basics</h2>
		<p>The Elements is a sandbox type game, meaning there is no objective, you just play around with the elements and explore the interactions between them.
		To place elements on the screen, simply touch within the work area. That's all there is to it!</p>
		<h2>Custom Elements</h2>
		<p>You can create your own elements to play with. To access the editor, select Custom Elements in the editor or from the main play screen. You can select from a list of elements you have already
			created, or create a new element. The editor has two tabs: Basic and Advanced.</p>
		<p>In the Basic tab, you select a built-in element to base your new element off of. You can then edit all of the values
			associated with your element, such as density, temperature, and phase changes. You can also change the color of the element in this tab. If you are done, scroll to the bottom and click "Save and Exit".</p>
		<p>If you choose to, you can also edit the finer details of the element in the Advanced tab. This view contains a list of all built-in elements and allows you to select what should happen when your
			custom element collides with each one. Below this list, you can also edit the special properties applying to your element. In this section, you can choose to make the element burn, explode,
			and generate particles.</p>
		<p>Once you have create your element, return to the main play screen and select it from the list of elements to use it!</p>
		<h2>Tools</h2>
	    <p><b>Brush:</b> The Brush is the default tool available to draw particles on the screen. Touch and drag to place particles.</p>
	    <p><b>Eraser:</b> Touch and drag with the eraser tool to clear elements.</p>
	    <p><b>Zoom/Pan:</b> Drag with a single finger to move what region of the scene you are looking at. Pinch with two fingers to zoom in and out.</p>
	    <p><b>Camera:</b> After selecting this tool, you will be prompted to take a picture with your phone camera. After saving the picture, it will be converted to an element scene and loaded. You should see your picture converted into elements. Buy the unlocked version to use more elements for a better conversion.</p>
	    <h2>Utilities</h2>
	    <p><b>Clear Screen:</b> Select to delete all elements on the screen.</p>
	    <p><b>Save/Load:</b> Save your scene to file, or load previously-saved scenes.</p>
	    <p><b>Enable Trails:</b> Adds fading after-images to particles, for a cool motion-blur effect!</p>
	    <h2>Record</h2>
	    <p>You can use the Kamcord library to record and share scenes that you've created. Other users can watch the videos you have published and vote on them.</p>
